# DART

DART is the Digital Archivist's Resource Tool. It was initially designed to help
depositors package materials in BagIt format and upload them to APTrust using
a simple, intuitive graphical interface.

DART supports plugins so developers can add new features without having to learn
all of the application's internals.

The DART documentation is divided into two parts:

* User Documentation
* Developer Documentation (for those interested in contributing plugins)

In addition to the developer docs, the API documentation covers the full
codebase.
